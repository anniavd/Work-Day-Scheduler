#  Work Day Scheduler


 Work Day Scheduler is a calendar application for hours of a day. The user will be able to **plan their** activities and **save** them.
 
The activities will be displayed and according to the **time of day** that is going on, a color will be displayed that will inform the user if the **time has passed** to carry out the activity, if the activity is **still in time** to be done or there is **still time to do it**.
This will be informed to the user through 3 colors (purple, red and green).
